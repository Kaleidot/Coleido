This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project: Coleido

This project was created and implemented within 3 days after I received a coding challenge about colour-rendering.<br />

### Project Name
The project name was coined using colour and kaleidoscope in order to showcase the beauty of colour in various forms.<br />

### Development Story
I started with brainstorming and sketching designs on the first day. There are quite a few things in my design I wasn't able to implement as I almost run out of time e.g applying the RGB vectors to a 3d cube could let us understand colours through the lens of Math. I will definitely continue with this piece of WebAR experience in the future.

What I managed to finish was the home page with 32,768 unique colours displayed and an animated web page for one of my favourite songs.

I have learnt a lot through this three-day intensive development experience. Finally, I got to try out CSS animations and I'm absolutely loving it.

No matter what the result is, I do appreciate this opportunity that pushed me to think, code, and feel the power of motivation and dedication.
